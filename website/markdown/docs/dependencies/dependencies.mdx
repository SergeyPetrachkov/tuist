# Dependencies.swift (Chimera Project)

Learn how to define standardise the contract between the dependency managers (Cocoapods, Carthage and SPM) and Tuist.

## How to get started

### Step 1: `Dependencies.swift`

1. Create `Dependencies.swift` in your project in `Tuist/` directory.
2. Run `tuist edit` to start editing your manifest files.
3. Add `import ProjectDescription` on the top of file.
4. Define your dependencies.

Example of project structure with added `Depedencies.swift` manifest file:

```bash
AwesomeProject
	|- App
	|- AppTests
	|- Tuist
		|- Dependencies.swift
	|- Project.swift
```

The snippet below shows an example `Dependencies.swift` manifest file:

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let dependencies = Dependencies([
    .carthage(origin: .github(path: "Alamofire/Alamofire"), requirement: .exact("5.0.4"), platforms: [.macOS])
])
```

### Step 2: `tuist dependencies` commands

1. Pull depedencies using `tuist depednecies fetch` command.
2. You can read more about commands [here](/docs/commands/dependencies.mdx).
3. Tuist will save depedencies in `/Tuist/Dependencies` directory.

The folder structure below shows how Tuist organize dependenies:

```bash
Tuist
    |- Dependencies.swift # Manifest
    |- Dependencies
        |- graph.json # comming soon
        |- Lockfiles
            |- Carthage.resolved
            |- Podfile.lock # comming soon
            |- Package.resolved # comming soon
        |- Carthage # stores content of `Carthage/Build` generated by `carthage`
            |- iOS
                |- Alamofire.framework
            |- tvOS
                |- Alamofire.framework
        |- Cocoapods # comming soon
            |- RxSwift
        |- SwftPackageManager # comming soon
            |- Moya
```

### Step 3: Link dependencies

You can link third-party dependencies like local ones.

```swift
let target = Target(dependencies: [
    .framework("Tuist/Dependencies/Carthage/iOS/Alamofire.framework"),
])
```
